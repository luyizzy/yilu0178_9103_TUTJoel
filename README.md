## Imaging Technique Inspiration
I have chosen Georges Seurat's oil painting "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" as my creative inspiration. This artwork employs the Pointillism technique, constructing the complete image through countless small dots of varied colors.

## Coding Technique Exploration  
For my project, I aim to digitally recreate this dotted artistic effect. This is the Connected Particles code in p5.js that I found. I believe this coding technique can serve as a reference to generate circular elements with random colors, thereby simulating the pointillism effect.

Through this technique, we can control the density of same-color circles being generated. This allows differently colored circles to continuously form and compose the image.
